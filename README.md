### hi

I'm the founder of [arete.gallery](url) where I develop on social practice art, computational tools for community building and data science for social impact. 


My GitHub profile will show you an assortment of personal projects, work experiences, and works in progress. If you'd like to ask any questions about my process, or would like to collaborate on a project, feel free to reach out via email!



For artistic or social impact: x@arete.gallery

For data science: xaviorlewis@uchicago.edu
