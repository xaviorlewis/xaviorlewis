### Hello, nice to meet you!

I'm the founder of [arete.gallery](url) where I develop on social practice art, computational tools for community building and data science for social impact. My GitHub profile will show you an assortment of personal projects, work experiences, and works in progress. Most of my projects are built using some combination of R for analysis, D3 for visuals, Svelte for frontend experience.

If you'd like to ask any questions about my process, or would like to collaborate on a project, feel free to reach out via email!

For artistic or social impact: x@arete.gallery 
For data science: xaviorlewis@uchicago.edu
